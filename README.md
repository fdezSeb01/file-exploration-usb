# files_exploration_electron

File Exploration USB meant to be ran from a standalone usb capable of executing inside any computer without neccesarily having access to it in case a person forgot the password to their own device. *User discretion is advised. This software is intended for responsible and ethical use only.

The main objective of this application is to offer a robust and compatible solution that allows users to explore or recover deleted files from any computer, regardless of the operating system or if access is available (it is important to note that this device only works on devices that do not have disk encryption such as BitLocker). This software should be distinguished by its ability to run on multiple platforms and must leverage privileged mode execution features to ensure complete and efficient operation. Through this project, the aim is to provide a powerful and effective tool that restores lost data or access to others, thereby minimizing the negative impact of losing critical information or access to systems.
